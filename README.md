HTML
On the HTML file I added an id to "search-engine-optimization" to ensure the links are connected to the proper section of the page. At first only the "online-reputation-management" and "social-media-marketing" were routing to the correct section. (Line 32)

For each of the images besides the background image, I created an alt description (Lines 33,40,47) . 

changed class to "search-online-social_media-services" so we could simplify the css class. (Line 32,39,46)


CSS

The list style type as none is not neccessary because the orginal default has no style type. So I commented out that property and attribute. (Line 34-37 CSS)

 Added the margin-bottom and color to this class. (line 87-88 css) Commented out Line 94-106 as this was added to line 87-88.

 Deleted .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost since i added the properties onto the benefits class (Line 112-114)

 Commented out benefit brand and benefit-cost as it was redundant, also linked 
these to the benefits class (line 119-133).

Created new class named "search-online-social_media-services" in order to take out 
redundant code (138-162). Also did the same for Lines 167-176, and lines 182-194.
